A simple, clean, and modern desktop application for focused Bible study and reading.

## About The Project

The goal of this app is to provide a simple and distraction-free experience for reading and studying the Word of God. It is built with web technologies and packaged as a cross-platform desktop application using Electron. This app will be packaged along with three other apps of my making in a Christian-themed linux distro that I plan to release soon.
